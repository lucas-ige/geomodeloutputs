The geomodeloutputs Python package aims to simplify the analysis of geoscientific model output data. It is moslty
designed to support my work at the Institut des Géosciences de l'Environnement (IGE), in Grenoble, France. But it might
also be useful to you too, who knows? It is released under a [free
software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) license.

NB: this is work in progress.
